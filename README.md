# Overview
Tetris coded in C++ displayed in terminal. Tutorial made by Javidx9 (or OneLoneCoder). Some code was referenced from Jim (or HipToBeeSquare). The original code spawned new pieces in the same orientation. The rotations are randomised in my iteration.

I don't know why, but the window size needs to be shrunk (only horizontally) until the play field and blocks look right. I'll try to fix this the next time I touch on this.
