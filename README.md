# Overview
Tetris coded in C++ displayed in terminal. Tutorial made by [Javidx9 (or OneLoneCoder)](https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9). Some code was referenced from [Jim (or HipToBeeSquare)](https://www.youtube.com/@HipToBeeSquare). The original code spawned new pieces in the same orientation. The rotations are randomised in my iteration.

I don't know why, but the window size needs to be shrunk (only horizontally) until the play field and blocks look right. I'll try to fix this the next time I touch on this.
